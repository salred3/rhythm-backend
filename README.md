This project provides a few utility modules that can be consumed by a higher
level `DashboardService`.

- `timer.aggregator.ts` – gather time-based data from events.
- `deadline.aggregator.ts` – analyze upcoming deadlines for tasks.
- `conflict.detector.ts` – detect and report scheduling conflicts.
